This is a basic project that implements a database for hotel management. It includes five main classes: Hotel, Room, Customer, Payment, and Booking.

The purpose of the application is to manage reservations and keep track of them, 
including check-in date with the assigned room, check-out time, price, room type with its size, guest capacity, and more. 
It also manages the payment method and the details of the customer making the reservation.
